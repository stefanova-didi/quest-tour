# Quest City Tour

## What it is

Quest City Tour is a mobile-first web app for guided city quests. An admin describes landmarks,
games and teams in YAML files. Each team gets a private link. Teams open the link on a phone and
work through a series of riddles:

- Answer the riddle (wrong answers are tolerated; hints and a "reveal" unlock over time or after
  enough attempts, at a time penalty).
- Walk to the landmark, take a team photo, and read its story.
- Finish all tasks (or run out of time) and see the results and the leaderboard.

Teammates on several phones share one run: if one phone solves a task, the others move on and show a
"teammate" toast.

The backend is FastAPI + SQLAlchemy (PostgreSQL, or SQLite for a quick local run) with blob storage
for photos and pictures (Azure Blob / Azurite, or plain files). The frontend is a React + Vite SPA.
The specs are in `specs/`, the design mocks in `frontend-mocks/`, and the look-and-feel proposals
(directions, variants, self-hosted fonts) in `design/` — open `design/index.html` in a browser.

## Prerequisites

- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (Python package and interpreter manager)
- Python 3.12 (`uv` installs it for you). If no 3.12 interpreter can run on your machine, use
  Python 3.13 instead: `uv sync --python 3.13` (the code stays 3.12-compatible).
- Node 20+ (with npm)
- Docker (optional): provides PostgreSQL and Azurite. Without it, use the
  [no-Docker fallback](#no-docker-fallback).

## One-command dev run (no Docker)

```bash
./scripts/dev.sh
```

Runs the [no-Docker fallback](#no-docker-fallback) end to end in one foreground
terminal: it writes `backend/.env` (SQLite + local file storage) on first run,
installs dependencies, migrates, runs `sync-config` (which prints the team game
links), then starts uvicorn and the Vite dev server together. Ctrl-C stops both;
every output line is tagged `[backend]` or `[frontend]` so the interleaved logs
stay readable.

## Docker dev path

Start PostgreSQL 16 and Azurite from the repo root:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Set up and start the backend:

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
uv sync
uv run alembic upgrade head
uv run sync-config
uv run uvicorn questtour.main:create_app --factory --reload
```

`sync-config` reads `CONFIG_DIR` (default `config`, relative to `backend/`; the sample files live in
`backend/config/`).

`sync-config` validates the YAML files, writes new tokens into `teams.yaml`, loads everything into the
database and prints one game link per team, e.g.

```
Game links:
  The Explorers — Sofia Old Town Quest: http://localhost:5173/play/<token> (new)
```

Start the frontend in a second terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the printed link (the Vite dev server runs on port 5173 and proxies `/api` to the backend on
port 8000; set `DEV_API_TARGET` to proxy somewhere else).

## Production-like local run

Build the SPA and let FastAPI serve it:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build          # creates frontend/dist
cd ../backend
```

Set these in `backend/.env` (or as environment variables):

```
STATIC_DIR=../frontend/dist
PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

Re-run `uv run sync-config` so the printed links use the new base URL, then start the server:

```bash
uv run uvicorn questtour.main:create_app --factory --port 8000
```

Open `http://localhost:8000/play/<token>`.

## No-Docker fallback

Without Docker, use SQLite and local file storage. Put this in `backend/.env`:

```
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./dev.db
HOST_ID=default
PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173
STORAGE_BACKEND=local
LOCAL_STORAGE_DIR=.storage
CONFIG_DIR=config
```

Then run the same commands as in the Docker path (`uv sync`, `uv run alembic upgrade head`,
`uv run sync-config`, `uv run uvicorn ...`). Photos and pictures are written under
`backend/.storage/`. If Python 3.12 is not available, run `uv sync --python 3.13` first.

For the production-like variant, also set `STATIC_DIR=../frontend/dist` and
`PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000`.

## Configuration reference

The admin configuration is three YAML files in the config directory plus an `images/` folder.

- `landmarks.yaml` — `landmarks:` list. Each has `id`, `name`, `task` (riddle text),
  `accepted_answers`, optional `hint1`, `hint2`, `tourist_info`, and optional pictures
  `task_picture` / `tourist_info_picture` (paths relative to the config directory, e.g.
  `images/task-domes.svg`). **`accepted_answers[0]` is the answer shown when a team reveals it.**
- `games.yaml` — `games:` list. Each has `id`, `name`, `time_zone`, `max_duration_minutes`,
  `reveal: { attempts, minutes, penalty_minutes }` (N attempts / X minutes before reveal unlocks,
  P penalty minutes), an `intro` text and `tasks:` (ordered landmark ids).
- `teams.yaml` — `teams:` (`id`, `name`, `participants`) and `assignments:` (`team`, `game`,
  `valid_from`, `valid_until`, `exit_message`). `token` fields are added by `sync-config`. An optional
  `service:` block (`team`, `name`) defines the service (test) team: `sync-config` writes one link per game
  under `service.tokens`.

Timestamps (`valid_from`, `valid_until`) **must be quoted** ISO-8601 strings, e.g.
`"2026-10-01T00:00:00"`. Without an offset they are read in the game's time zone.

### `sync-config`

```bash
uv run sync-config                              # validate, issue tokens, load into the database
uv run sync-config --validate-only              # validate the YAML only; change nothing
uv run sync-config --reissue TEAM_ID GAME_ID    # replace one team's token; the old link stops working
uv run sync-config --config-dir path/to/config  # override CONFIG_DIR
```

Warnings:

- `sync-config` writes the tokens into `teams.yaml`. **Commit `teams.yaml` after issuing tokens and
  keep the repository private** — the file holds live game links.
- Service (test) links are for testing only: they ignore every time limit, can be reset from the game
  screen and never appear on a leaderboard. Do not hand them to real teams.
- Game rule edits (max duration, N/X/P, validity windows) **apply live to running games**.
  Shortening them can end a game that is in progress. Only the landmark order of a running game is
  frozen.
- To swap two team names, rename one team through a temporary name in two `sync-config` runs
  (team names are unique, so a direct swap fails and rolls back).

## Deployment (Azure)

Production runs on Azure App Service, PostgreSQL Flexible Server and Blob storage. The infrastructure is
Terraform in `infra/`; GitHub Actions does the rest:

- **Pull requests** run CI: backend ruff and pytest (SQLite and PostgreSQL), frontend typecheck and
  vitest, static checks of the workflows, scripts and Terraform, and a build and smoke test of the
  deploy package.
- **Merge to `main`** re-runs CI and deploys to App Service through GitHub OIDC, once the repository
  variable `DEPLOY_ENABLED` is `true`. Commits that only touch `backend/config/`, `infra/`, `specs/`,
  `frontend-mocks/` or Markdown files never deploy. *Deploy* can also be run by hand, to redeploy or
  to roll back.
- **Infrastructure** changes go through the separate, manually run *Infrastructure (Terraform)*
  workflow: `plan`, then `apply` with `confirm = APPLY`.

- **Releases** are version tags on `main` (`v1.2.0`). Pushing one runs the *Release* workflow: it
  publishes a GitHub Release with generated notes and deploys that exact tag.

Build the deploy package locally with `bash scripts/package-app.sh dist/app.zip` (after
`npm run build` in `frontend/`) and check it with `bash scripts/smoke-package.sh dist/app.zip`.

### Which version is running

Every build carries its version, from `git describe`: the release tag (`v1.2.0`) when the build is a
release, `v1.2.0-3-g6dd4e31` for a `main` build three commits past it, or a bare commit hash before the
first tag. It is shown in the app footer (cover, welcome and finish screens, and the admin sidebar)
and reported by `GET /api/health` as `{"status": "ok", "version": "v1.2.0"}`; the deploy's smoke check
waits until production answers with the version it just shipped. The package carries it in a `VERSION`
file; `APP_VERSION` in the environment overrides it, and a dev checkout shows `development build`.

First-time setup, GitHub variables, day-2 operations and troubleshooting are in
[`infra/README.md`](infra/README.md).

## Tests

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
uv run pytest -q

# Optional: also run the PostgreSQL tests
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://questtour:questtour@localhost:5432/questtour uv run pytest -q

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm test
```

Tests marked `postgres` are skipped unless `TEST_DATABASE_URL` points at PostgreSQL. Lint and type
checks: `uv run ruff check .` (backend), `npm run typecheck` (frontend).

## Photos and storage

Team photos are stored in the `photos` container as

```
photos/{Game}/{Team}/{timestamp}_{position}_{landmark}.{ext}
```

for example `photos/Sofia-Old-Town-Quest/The-Explorers/2026-10-03_14-05-09_01_Alexander-Nevsky-Cathedral.jpg`
(names are made file-safe; a same-second collision gets a `_2`, `_3`… suffix). With
`STORAGE_BACKEND=azure` against Azurite, browse them with
[Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/storage/storage-explorer) (connect to
the local emulator). With `STORAGE_BACKEND=local` they are plain files under `LOCAL_STORAGE_DIR`
(`ls -R backend/.storage/photos`).
