"""The memories album (issue #33): everything a finished run collected, in reading order.

One chapter per task the team completed – the landmark, its story and every photo the team took
there – plus the facts of the day. Available only once the run has ended (finished or timed out):
during the game players never see photos (R-10). Photo bytes are served by the player API through
``photo_url``, which checks the same things again.
